This post marks the official release of my personal website, built using Jekyll. 

Even though I am in the start of a long and difficult journey, I decided to document it and share it with the world.


The website is designed to showcase my academic and research journey, including my studies in computer engineering and material and nanostructures science at Politecnico di Milano.
