I'm a computer engineering student at Politecnico di Milano currently taking additional studies in material and nanostructures science. My goal is to become a quantum computing researcher, drawn to the exciting intersection of materials and computing. When I'm not studying, I enjoy tinkering with code and research materials publishings.

Currently reading and understanding [Quantum Mechanics for Nanostructures](https://books.google.it/books?id=PF1ESCe4F7kC).
